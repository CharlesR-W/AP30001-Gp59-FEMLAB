  This is a lab completed for the class AP30001-FEM "Finite Element Analysis" at TU Delft.
  It contains the completed MATLAB code to run a simulation of a chicken-breast being microwaved, according to the heat-diffusion equations, which we solve numerically using finite-element methods.
  
  Much of the code-skeleton was provided as part of the project, and thus not written by us - the post-processing code, and report, as well as some of the "fill-in-the-blank" mathematical sections are our own.
